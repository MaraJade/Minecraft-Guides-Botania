Pure Daisies are the first and most important functional flower you can create, it's advised you make at least 2 (a good healthy amount would be 8 since it allows you to craft more at once). These flowers can be used to turn Wood and Stone into their more functional counterparts: Living Wood and Living Rock.

Pure Daisys must be placed on Grass or Dirt but do not need direct sunlight to function. Surround the Pure Daisy with 8 Stone or Logs and wait. The Wood and Stone surrounding the Pure Daisys will sparkle (this means its working) and eventually turn into Living Stone and Living Wood.
