The Runic Altar is used to make Runes, it requires Mana to function and also requires certain items to be either thrown or Right-Clicked (in any order) into the Altar, much like the Petal Apothecary you can also retrieve its that have been put in by mistake by Right-Clicking with an empty hand. Once the Altar has been activated it is no longer possible to get items back.

Once the correct items are in the Altar (you can see these floating around) and the Altar has received enough Mana from any linked Mana Spreader it will start crafting, you will hear a lighting sound and when looking at the Altar you can see a small timer going. Once this time has completed and you start seeing a bunch of blue sparks you will need to complete the craft by dropping or Right-Clicking 1 Living rock then you will need to Right-Click the Altar with your Wand of the Forest. This will complete the craft and give you Runes!
