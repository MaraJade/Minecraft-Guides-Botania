When used, it opens the player's Ender Chest inventory at the cost of 250 Mana.

If used on another player, it will open their Ender Chest instead at the cost of 5,000 Mana.

If a Hand of Ender is present in the player's inventory, the Rod of the Shifting Crust will be able to use the contents of their Ender inventory, using an additional 5 Mana per block swapped.
