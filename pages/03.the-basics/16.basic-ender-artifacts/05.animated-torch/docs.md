When it is hit by a Mana burst or a Hovering Hourglass placed on top of the torch turns, it changes the direction it emits a Redstone signal on.

When placed, it faces away from the player in a horizontal direction. Shift right-clicking the torch with an empty hand will turn the torch 90 degrees clockwise.

Right-clicking with a Wand of the Forest will change the mode of the torch. It has 3 modes, which change the direction the torch turns when triggered:

* Toggle (default): Turns 180 degrees.
* Rotate: Turns 90 degrees clockwise.
* Random: Chooses a random direction.
