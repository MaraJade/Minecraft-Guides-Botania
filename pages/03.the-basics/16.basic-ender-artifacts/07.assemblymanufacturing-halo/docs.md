The Assembly Halo is a portable crafting tool added by Botania. When held, a ring divided into 12 segments will appear around the player. Right-clicking on the Crafting Table segment will open the crafting interface. The other 11 segments can hold one recipe each.

Right-clicking on an empty one will set it to the last recipe made in the crafting segment. Right-clicking a slot with a recipe will craft the item once using items from the player's inventory. Shift-left clicking will remove the recipe.
