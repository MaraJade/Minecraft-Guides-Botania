Mana in Botania is like RF to Thermal Expansion, it's the mods “power”, Botania is more of a tech mod than a magic mod.

Before we get into generating Mana we need to first explore how to store Mana, as you will need some kind of storage before you can put it to good use. Mana can be stored in Mana Pools. There are 2 sizes: a Diluted Mana Pool which will hold a small amount of Mana and a normal Mana Pool which will hold 100 times the amount of a Diluted Mana Pool (1,000,000 Mana).
