Mana in Botania is like RF to Thermal Expansion, it's the mods “power”, Botania is more of a tech mod than a magic mod.

Before we get into generating Mana we need to first explore how to store Mana, as you will need some kind of storage before you can put it to good use. Mana can be stored in Mana Pools. There are 2 sizes: a Diluted Mana Pool which will hold a small amount of Mana and a normal Mana Pool which will hold 100 times the amount of a Diluted Mana Pool (1,000,000 Mana). 

![](mana%20pool.jpg)

The Diluted Mana Pool is mostly used as a buffer for bigger contraptions as it only holds a small amount which is perfect for smaller projects.

With a Wand of the Forest in hand you will be able to see how much Mana is within the Mana Pool, as this bar is so small and it's not possible to make it any bigger. You can also see how much is in a Mana Pool by just looking at it, if you can’t see any Mana then it's probably empty and if it looks around half full then it's probably half full, you get the picture.

Once you have Mana in your Mana Pool (more on this later) you can then start crafting more essential Botania items. Dropping certain items into a Mana Pool (Q by default) will cause them to be infused with Mana. These new Mana infused items can be then used to craft more Botania items.

>>>> You will be able to see if the Mana Pool has enough Mana to convert the item by hovering over the Mana Pool with any of the below items in hand, a check mark means you have enough and a cross means you need more Mana.
