The Petal Apothecary is the first tool used for crafting within Botania. Now that you have a healthy supply of petals (or flowers) it's time to put these petals to good use. The Petal Apothecary is crafted with Cobblestone, Cobblestone Slabs and any colour petal. The Petal Apothecary can then be placed down anywhere (it’s not dangerous) but it will need to have a supply of water. 

Once placed down the Petal Apothecary will need to be filled with water, this can’t be pumped but must be filled with a bucket. The basic idea behind the Petal Apothecary is with water and a few petals you will be able to create useful flowers

Fill the Petal Apothecary with water by right-clicking it with a full bucket, next throw in (with Q) 4 White Petals. These petals will stay within the Petal Apothecary. You can see what's in the Petal Apothecary by looking at it. You will also notice that you will need to add seeds in order to craft our first flower. Throwing in seeds will give you a Pure Daisy and will also empty the Petal Apothecary.

If you fill the Petal Apothecary with water after crafting a message will appear letting you know that you can craft the previous recipe again by right-clicking with an empty hand! You must have the required ingredients within your inventory or this to work. This will place the previous recipe (4 White Flowers) back into the Petal Apothecary, all you need to do is add the seeds.

>>>>> There is a 20-second timer on when you can craft the previous recipe!

If you have thrown the wrong petals in or wish to change the flower you are crafting you can shift right-click with an empty hand to remove petals from the last items you threw in.
Botania is a very visual mod so crafting is a little easier but remembering what flower requires what materials is more difficult. With JEI installed and Pressing “U” on the Petal Apothecary you can see all the craftable flowers/items within the Petal Apothecary.

The Petal Apothecary can also be filled with lava, this can be safely placed on any wood and the sparks coming off it will not burn anything surrounding it! You will also not be injured when walking on top of this. Throwing items into it will destroy the said item.

You can also customise your Petal Apothecary by throwing (Q) Vines into it. This will give it a bit of a rustic look.

Lastly, if you connect a Comparator to the Petal Apothecary’s base it will emit a Redstone signal when it is full of water.
