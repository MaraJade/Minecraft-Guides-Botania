The Petal Apothecary is the first tool used for crafting within Botania. Now that you have a healthy supply of petals (or flowers) it's time to put these petals to good use. The Petal Apothecary is crafted with Cobblestone, Cobblestone Slabs and any colour petal. The Petal Apothecary can then be placed down anywhere (it’s not dangerous) but it will need to have a supply of water. 

Once placed down the Petal Apothecary will need to be filled with water, this can’t be pumped but must be filled with a bucket. The basic idea behind the Petal Apothecary is with water and a few petals you will be able to create useful flowers

Fill the Petal Apothecary with water by right-clicking it with a full bucket, next throw in (with Q) 4 White Petals. These petals will stay within the Petal Apothecary. You can see what's in the Petal Apothecary by looking at it. You will also notice that you will need to add seeds in order to craft our first flower. Throwing in seeds will give you a Pure Daisy and will also empty the Petal Apothecary.
