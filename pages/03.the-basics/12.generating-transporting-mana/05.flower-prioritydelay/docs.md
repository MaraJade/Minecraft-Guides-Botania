As you work your way through Botania and you use more and more flowers and the more complex contraptions you build you will soon realise that you might not want all of your flowers performing tasks all at once. Instead of planting flowers on Grass/Dirt, you can use Podzil, this will add a small delay to the flower before it can perform an action. Mycelium will create a longer delay! If you want to turn them off entirely you can apply a Redstone signal.
