It is important to know that flowers will not generate Mana unless they are linked to a Mana spreader. Every Mana Spreader that is placed down also needs to be linked to a Mana Pool, Mana Spreaders will not link to anything unless told to. Mana Spreaders will not link to any block that can not accept Mana. The only exception to this is Pulse Mana Spreaders, these will send Mana regardless if it is attached to a block that can accept Mana.

Placing a Mana Spreader down and holding a Wand of the Forest will show you a green laser with a Spark, there is no range limit on Mana spreaders but after 12 blocks (the big green spark) Mana will start to fade away, less Mana will reach its destination. Ideally, you never want to go beyond this 12 block range (for now) as you will end up losing Mana.
