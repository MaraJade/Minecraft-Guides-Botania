Simple Generating Flora are cheap and work “ok”, they will help you get started and help you generate a little Mana. Some of these flowers are passive and some require items to generate Mana, most of these can be automated.

Flowers **MUST** be linked to a Mana Spreader, unlinked flowers will not generate Mana, also flowers can not be bound to Mana Pools. There are a few ways to bind flowers to Mana Spreaders. 

If you first place down a Mana Spreader and then a flower, the flower will bind to the nearest Mana Spreader. You can also choose what Mana Spreader you wish to bind a flower using Binding mode and Shift Right-Clicking the flower and the Mana Spreader. Placing a Mana Spreader after placing flowers requires each flower to be linked to the Mana Spreader manually.

If you destroy a Mana Spreader that has been bound to a flower you can see where the Mana spreader was by hovering over it with the Wand of the Forest. You can also check if a flower is bound to a certain Mana Spreader by hovering over it, this will cause the Mana Spreader which is bound to the flower to be highlighted.

Hovering over flowers will also display a Mana Spreader with either an X or a checkmark, this will tell you very quickly if the flower is bound to a Mana Spreader or not.

>>>>> It takes 2 seconds to check if a flower is bound to a Mana Spreader and each flower should be checked!

Basic Flowers only need petals to be crafted fortunately, there are 2 flowers you can start off with.
