This Mana generating flower will consume still water that is placed at the same height as the flower in a 3x3 area around it and produce Mana, these flowers also function faster when it rains. These flowers will decay after 1 hour so they will need to be replaced.

This flower will **EAT** any still water around it, so having infinite water sources around this flower is advisable.
