Holding all of these flowers can become a pain especially early game. The Flower Pouch will hold 64 of each flower colour and will also place any flowers picked up into its inventory. The flower pouch does not need to be on the hot bar for it to “suck” up flowers. The pouch will only pick up SINGLE high flowers not double-height ones. Keep in mind to check this pouch every so often, you can also force flowers into your inventory by having the pouch in hand.
