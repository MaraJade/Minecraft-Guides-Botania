The Bellethorne will use Mana to harm any living beings (except for players) within its radius. This flower can also be turned on and off with a Redstone signal. The Bellethrone is able to kill a zombie within a few seconds. The Dreadthorne is similar to the Bellethorne but it will only kill adult animals.
