Now that you have a healthy supply of Mana (thanks to the Endoflame or the Hydrangea) you will probably wonder what can be done with Mana, what function it has and how it can help us within our world.

There are currently 5 functional flowers that only need petals and Redstone Root to be crafted, some these flowers will all require Mana to function, you can set these next to Mana Pools to draw Mana from or you can bind a Mana Spreader to a flower that is a bit further away.

>>>>> Any flowers that are crafted with Redstone Root can be turned on and off via a Redstone signal.
