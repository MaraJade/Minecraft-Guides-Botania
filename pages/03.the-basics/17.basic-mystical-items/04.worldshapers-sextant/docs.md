The Worldshapers Sextant is used to help with building circles. Holding Right-Click on a block will show a halo around the block, in the middle of the screen a circle will appear with a number, the number is the size of the circle, while still holding Right-Click and moving your mouse you can change the size of the circle. Letting go of Right-Click will spawn ghost cobblestone of the circle.

 Filling the entire circle preview with blocks will remove it, displaying a message "Structure Complete!".

Shift right-clicking with the sextant will remove the circle preview if one exists.
