Mana Steel can be used to make useful tools and armor but only really comes into its own when you can carry Mana around with you. Manasteel Armor has the same properties as Iron armor but it's more enchantable, also if you are carrying a Mana Tablet (which has Mana) the armor will not take durability damage but will instead drain the Mana Tablet. When a full set is worn it will reduce the Mana cost on all Mana using tools and rods by 10%
