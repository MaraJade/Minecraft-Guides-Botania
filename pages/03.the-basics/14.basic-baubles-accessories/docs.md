Before we start crafting Flowers it's a VERY good idea to craft a few tools that will help when it comes to setting up flowers and a few quality of life upgrades. Some of these tools do not require Mana to function.

### Manaseer Monocle
The Manaseer Monocle is an essential Bauble slot item that will make working with Botania much easier and is essential. This simple tool will show you the range of each working flower.

Ring of Mana
This ring should be one of the first rings you make, it will absorb Mana when thrown into a Mana Pool, the ring acts just like a Mana Tablet but can be worn in a Baubles slot
Ring of Magnetization
The Ring of Magnetization is also a Bauble slot that will pull items towards you within a 13x13 block range. The only items it will not pull are items that contain Mana such as Mana Tablets and it will also not pull Applied Energistics 2 crystal seeds.
Ring of Correction
When worn, the Ring of Correction will automatically switch tools within your hand that will be appropriate for the material, if you are mining sand with your pick it will switch out the pick to a shovel. This effect will only work with tools that can use Mana
Invisibility Cloak
This Bauble can be worn in the body slot and will render the wearer invisible as long as its fed Mana via a Mana Tablet or Ring.
Floral Obedience Stick
With the Floral Obedience Stick in hand, Right-Clicking a Mana Spreader or a Mana Pool will bind all relevant nearby flowers to it.
The Spectator
When worn and holding a block, any chest containing the held block will show bubbles in the container, this will work from any item that has an inventory (furnace, chest minecarts), it will show dropped items and also mobs who are holding that item.

### Tiny Planet
When worn the Tiny Planet will cause nearby Mana sparks to orbit you, these will grow as more and more sparks are attracted and slowly fade away. This can also be converted into a block that can be placed into the world with the same effect.
