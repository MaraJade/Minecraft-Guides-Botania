### Mana Pylon
Mana Pylons work just like Book Shelves but only require 2 to get the enchanting table to level 30!

### Drum of the Wild/Canopy
The Drum of the Wild and the Drum of the Canopy are physical versions of the Horn of the Wild/Canopy that can be placed in the world. The only difference is that these drums will need a Mana Pulse to activate:

### Eye of the Ancients
This block will send a Redstone signal when it sees any animals in front of it within its 6 block range, it will send a signal as soon as it sees more than 2 animals, 2 animals will send a signal of 1, 3 a signal of 2 and so on.

### Fel Pumpkin
When put on top of 2 iron bars the Fel Pumpkin will turn into a Blaze, Blazes spawned this way will drop Blaze Powder at a good rate instead of Blaze Rods.

### Spreader Turntables
Mana Spreaders can be set on these turntables which will make them spin, initially, these will turn anticlockwise but this can be changed with the wand of the forest, the speed can also be changed this way.

### Teru Teru Bozu
The Teru Teru Bozu can be placed in the world and will detect if it is raining or if there is a snowstorm, it will give off a Redstone signal when bad weather is detected. This weather can be dispersed by dropping or Right-Clicking a Sunflower near the Teru Teru Bozu.
