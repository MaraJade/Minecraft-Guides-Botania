Manastars will tell you if you are gaining Mana or losing Mana within a certain range, placing them down near a Mana Pool and watching them will tell you if you are gaining Mana within the pool by giving off a Blue spark or a Red spark if you are losing Mana. Helpful if you want to glance over at the pool rather than using the Wand of the Forest.
