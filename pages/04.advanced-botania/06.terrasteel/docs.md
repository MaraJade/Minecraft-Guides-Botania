Terrasteel is the next tier of metal within Botania and it requires about half a Mana Pool of Mana to craft (around 500,000). You will need to craft a bunch of these so hopefully, you have a few Endoflame farms.

You will also require Mana Sparks since using a Mana Spreader could lead to the craft failing and wasting Mana. If a craft does fail then any Mana Spent will not be deposited back into any Mana Pools but instead will just vanish.

Set down 5 Livingrock and 4 Lapis Lazuli blocks, on top of the middle block you must place down a Terrestrial Agglomeration, a spark must be put on top of the Terrestrial Agglomeration before crafting can begin.
