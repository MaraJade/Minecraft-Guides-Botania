The force relay is probably one of the more complicated items when it comes to Botania, although it can be crafted early game it is recommended you get to grips with the basics of how Mana works before jumping into Force Relays.

>>>>> A few lenses will be covered within this section that has not been covered thus far within the guide. Some of these Lenses are not available till late game and are only here to best demonstrate the function of the Force Relay.

Force Relays have a few functions but they can be combined with Mana Spreaders and Lenses to create amazing machines.
