The force relay is probably one of the more complicated items when it comes to Botania, although it can be crafted early game it is recommended you get to grips with the basics of how Mana works before jumping into Force Relays.

>>>>> A few lenses will be covered within this section that has not been covered thus far within the guide. Some of these Lenses are not available till late game and are only here to best demonstrate the function of the Force Relay.

Force Relays have a few functions but they can be combined with Mana Spreaders and Lenses to create amazing machines.

Force relays on their own are basically a connection between 2 blocks wirelessly, they can move blocks and they can connect blocks. Please remember that Force Relays can not be broken with a Pickaxe but can only be picked up using the Wand of the Forest with Shift Right-Click.

First off Moving Blocks, any block bound to a force replay will mimic whatever happens to the Force Relay. To connect a Force Relay to a block you will need to set your Wand to bind mode and then Right-click the Force Relay, you should hear a beep, then right-click the target block, this should also give you a beep.

If you move the force relay with a piston, the block that has been bound with the force relay will also move in the same direction. The only exclusion to this is sticky pistons, any force Relays moved with the sticky piston will not move the target block. You can only **PUSH** blocks with the Force Relay.
