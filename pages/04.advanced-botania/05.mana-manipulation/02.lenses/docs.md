Lenses can be added to any Force Relay (right-clicking with lense in hand) and will augment the pulse, some of these lenses can also be combined with each other to give both desired effects, the same 2 Lenses can not be combined. Some Lenses can only be used with Pulse Mana Spreaders as these can be linked to ANY block.
