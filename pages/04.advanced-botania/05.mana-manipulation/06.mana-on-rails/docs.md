Mana Pool can be combined with a Minecart to create a Minecart with a Mana Pool, this can be used to transport Mana using a rail system. The Minecart with a Mana Pool can only be used to transfer Mana, you can not throw objects into it to absorb Mana nor can it have Mana sent to it via Mana Spreaders.
