The Narslimmus will consume any natural Slime in a 5×5×5 area around it. The amount of Mana generated is based on the slime's size: 

Mana=1200\times 2 Size -where size corresponds to the size of the slime (smallest = 1, medium = 2, large = 4).

It will not consume Slimes spawned by artificial means. Killed slimes do not split or drop any items.
