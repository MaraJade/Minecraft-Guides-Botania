This flower will absorb TNT blasts and generate a huge amount of Mana practically nullifying the explosion. This flower will only absorb blasts if it has NO Mana stored within it. Itâ€™s a good idea to carry a Benevolent Goddess Charm when trying out any sort of automation setups as these will stop blocks from breaking from TNT.

To automate this flower does require further research into Botania, for late-game its perfect and can be a great source of mana, play around with this with caution.
