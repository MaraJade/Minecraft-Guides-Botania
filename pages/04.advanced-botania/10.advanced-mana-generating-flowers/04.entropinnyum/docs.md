This flower will absorb TNT blasts and generate a huge amount of Mana practically nullifying the explosion. This flower will only absorb blasts if it has NO Mana stored within it. Itâ€™s a good idea to carry a Benevolent Goddess Charm when trying out any sort of automation setups as these will stop blocks from breaking from TNT.
