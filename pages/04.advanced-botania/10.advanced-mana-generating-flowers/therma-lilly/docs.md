The Therma Lilly will suck up any lava near it (this must be at the same height)  and generate a huge amount of Mana for 45 seconds, the only downside to this flower is that it has a 5 minute cool after its 45-second timer is up. Any lava that is near the flower during this 5-minute cooldown will be destroyed and the plant will not generate any Mana instead it will start its 5-minute cooldown window again.
