This flower will eat cakes near it to generate mana. Every 4 seconds, the flower attempts to consume one slice of Cake in an 11×11×11 area around itself, producing 1,800 Mana per slice, resulting in 10,800 per Cake.

A Kekimurus can store 9,001 Mana internally and can be bound to a Mana Spreader within 6 blocks of itself to transfer its Mana. There are many builds that automate this flower and can also be done just with Botania:
