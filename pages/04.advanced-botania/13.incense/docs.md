Potions are great but require inventory space, Incense can be made in the same way as Brews but can be placed within an Incense plate. When placed within a plate they will give the infused Brew effect within a 30 block radius for an hour and a half. The only drawback is that once lit (with flint and Steel) they can not be removed and they cost 10 times as much Mana to produce.
