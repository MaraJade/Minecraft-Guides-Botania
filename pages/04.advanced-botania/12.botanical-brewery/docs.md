Brewing with Mana can give much better results than the traditional way of making potions. Vials hold up to 4 charges of a potion and Flasks hold up to 6. Initially, you will only be able to craft Vials (4 charges) but as you move on with Botania flasks will be available. 

To start brewing you will need to place down a Brewing stand and have a Mana spreader aimed at it. Next you can right-click the Vial into the stand as well as the required ingredients. Once all the ingredients are in the stand crafting will start, once finished the potion will pop off the brewing stand.
