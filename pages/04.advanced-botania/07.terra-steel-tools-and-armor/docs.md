Terra steel can be turned into blocks and nuggets just like any other metal, it can also be used to make tools and armour.

The Terra Steel armor is a slight upgrade from Mana Steel, providing diamond level protection, 70 Mana will be used from the playerâ€™s inventory (from a Mana Tablet or Mana holding ring) per-point of durability repairs as well as a small knockback resistance per item worn.
