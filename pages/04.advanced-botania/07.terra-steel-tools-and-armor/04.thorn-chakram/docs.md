The Thorn Chakram is straight out of Terraria, 6 can be stacked up and then thrown in quick succession, these will slice through enemies poisoning them in the process, it will also bounce off walls a few times before it comes back into your inventory. Useful for close-quarters combat and useless in open spaces.
