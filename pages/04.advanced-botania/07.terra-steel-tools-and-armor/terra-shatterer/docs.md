This powerful Pickaxe has a few functions, throwing it into a Mana Pool will increase its rank, the default rank is D, by throwing into a Mana Pool you will increase its rank, the amount of Mana required from D-C is only a Little, from C-B requires a Full Mana Pool and then the cost increase tenfold from Ranks B-A and tenfold again from A-S and then Tenfold again from S-SS. 

With each rank the Terra Shatterer is able to mine bigger areas when right clicked, this will drain Mana the higher the rank you go so having a healthy supply of Mana is advised. The Terra Shatterer will also mine up grass, sand, gravel and Soul Sand and act as a shovel.

The Terra Shatter will consume Mana even when it is not being used and it is active, it will also never despawn when dropped on the ground.
