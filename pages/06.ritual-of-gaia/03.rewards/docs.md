The Gaia Guardian will drop 8 Gaia Spirits upon defeating it, needed for many end-game items in Botania. The Gaia II guardian drops 16 spirits and a random amount of Manasteel Ingot, Mana Pearl, and Mana Diamond, as well as a Dice of Fate; when rolled it will give you one of six powerful Relics.

### Eye of the Flügel
It is a relic which will allow the user to shift right-click a block to bind, then hold right-click to teleport back to the block it is bound to.

### Key of the King’s Law
When holding right-click, this item will create floating circles with gold tools inside of them. They can be launched in the direction the player is looking.

### Ring of Loki
one of the three mythic rings of the Aesir, the Ring of Loki allows for the wearer to tap upon the Trickster God Loki to effectively be in multiple places at once.

The setup for this ability requires, first and foremost, an empty hand. Shift-right clicking on a block with said empty hand while having the Ring of Loki equipped begins the procedure. Once the source block is selected, shift-right clicking on other blocks in the world will add them to the relative positions affected by this power. In order to finish the procedure, one would shift-right click the original block.

Shift-right clicking on one of the blocks that has been selected will remove it. To reset a completed selection, shift-right click the ground twice.

After the selection is complete, when looking around, one will notice multiple boxes in relative positions to the selected block. When a block is placed while sneaking, the placing action is mimicked on all of those positions, allowing for one to place a large number of blocks at once. This ability also extends to destruction using the Terra Shatterer or Terra Truncator.

Such a power does not come for free of course. Utilizing this ability costs Mana from the user's inventory per each block placed. It's important to note that the more blocks that are selected, the more expensive each placed block becomes.

### Ring of Thor
One of the three mythic rings of the Aesir, the Ring of Thor, when worn, bestows upon the wearer the might of the Thunder God Thor. This power drastically increases the strength of area of effect mining with a Terra Shatterer.

### Ring of Odin
One of the three mythic rings of the Aesir, the Ring of Odin grants its wearer the vitality and resistance of the Elder God Odin. As well as the addition of ten extra hearts of health, the Ring of Odin protects the wearer from various kinds of elemental damage such as drowning, suffocation, fire or starvation.

### The Fruit of Grisaia
A relic that will keep the owner saturated when eaten using Mana from his inventory.
