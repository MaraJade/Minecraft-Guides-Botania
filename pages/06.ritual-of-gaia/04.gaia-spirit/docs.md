You should have at least by now fought the Gaia Guardian a few times, this should give you enough Gia spirit to craft the final items within Botania
Cloak of Sin
When worn in the Baubles Body slot, the Cloak will damage all nearby monsters for the same amount the wearer was damaged by and go on a 10-second cooldown. The Cloak does not trigger on unblockable damage like magic or fall damage.
Globetrotterâ€™s Sash
When worn in the Baubles Belt slot, it will increase the wearer's speed by about 2.8 m/s, their jump height by 2 blocks, and grant them step assist if not sneaking. In addition, the player will take 3 less points of fall damage. The Mana cost of these abilities is 2 Mana per second.
Crimson Pendant
The Crimson Pendant is an upgrade of the Pyroclast Pendant. Its entry in the Lexica Botania is initially hidden until the player acquires Elven Knowledge. When worn, the player will become immune to fire or lava damage and will also be unable to be set on fire.
Nimbus Amulet
The Nimbus Amulet, when worn by the player in the Baubles Amulet slot, the player will be able to triple jump, adding one jump compared to the Cirrus Amulet. Jumping in mid-air will nullify all fall damage and downwards momentum.
Life Aggregator
The Life Aggregator allows the player to move Monster Spawners by right-clicking a Monster Spawner with it. This will absorb the Spawner into the Life Aggregator. Right-clicking the Aggregator to any block will place it down and release the Spawner, which will break the Aggregator in the process.
Rod of the Unstable Reservoir
By using Mana from a player-carried Mana Tablet, the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir can create homing missiles which attack nearby foes.

When used, missiles will spawn above the user in quick succession if there are any hostile mobs within a 12 block radius. The cost of spawning a single missile is 120 Mana. These missiles deal 7 points of damage and home onto any monsters nearby. Missiles will despawn if no valid target is in their range.

When this Rod is given to a Livingwood Avatar, it will create homing missiles, though at a slower rate compared to the player, using 40 Mana per missile.

Shard of Laputa
When used on a block, it will start lifting the nearby ground 42 blocks up, slowly creating a floating island. There are 20 varieties of the shard, each with higher Shard Power, up to Shard Power XX.

An island created by the level I shard has a radius of 14 blocks. Each additional level of Shard Power increases the radius by 1 block, up to a maximum of a radius of 33 blocks.

In terms of the dimensions the lifted island would take up, a level I shard will lift a sphere of dimensions 27x27x27 blocks, while a level XX shard will produce a sphere of dimensions 65x65x65.
Gaia Mana Spreader
The Gaia Mana Spreader is the highest tier of Mana Spreader available and allows for Mana bursts to travel longer without losing Mana.
