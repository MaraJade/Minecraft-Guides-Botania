# Ritual Of Gaia

The Gaia Guardian is a hostile boss summoned in Botania. It takes on the appearance of the player that summoned it, albeit being far darker in colour.

It has a base of about 200 health points and unknown damage; however, the health and damage get multiplied depending on the amount of players in the arena. With two, the health is 600. This is a dangerous boss that is very difficult to defeat; this is due to the Guardian's extremely frequent teleporting, almost always after you hit it, and release of Gaia Traps. These traps cause a Wither and, for a shorter duration, a Blindness effect; for this reason, it is recommended to have several botanical brews on you for the fight. It will also spawn grey Pixies to attack the player frequently.
