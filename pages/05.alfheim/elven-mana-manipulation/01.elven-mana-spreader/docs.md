The Elven Mana Spreader is an upgrade to the standard Mana Spreader. Each mana burst contains 1.5 times more mana than that of the standard Spreader, allowing it to move more mana more quickly. The mana burst range is increased to 20 blocks. The internal storage is the same as the standard Spreader.
