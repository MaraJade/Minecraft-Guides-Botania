### Life Imbuer
When placed on top of a Monster Spawner, it will allow it to work when no players are in its range for a cost of 6 Mana per tick.

The Life Imbuer can hold up to 160 Mana, which can be provided with a Mana Spreader.

### Resolute Ivy
Resolute Ivy can be applied to an item in the crafting grid. Items that have Resolute Ivy applied will stay in the player's inventory on their next death, with the Ivy being removed from the item. It cannot be applied to items that return an item after crafting, like filled Buckets or Pestle and Mortar.

### Starcaller
The Starcaller uses Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 100 Mana per point of durability. When swung, it has a chance to spawn a missile falling at the targeted block from 24 blocks above at the cost of 120 Mana and 1 durability. The missile deals 5 damage and has a 25% chance to deal double damage.

### Thunder Caller
The Thundercaller uses Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing the item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 60 Mana per point of durability. It deals 7 (Heart.svgHeart.svgHeart.svgHalf Heart.svg) points of damage on attack.

When a creature is attacked with this sword, a weak chain lightning attack will deal 5 (Heart.svgHeart.svgHalf Heart.svg) points of damage to a random monster in an 8 block radius, then jump to a next target in the same range around the previous one, dealing 1 (Half Heart.svg) less point in damage. This is repeated until 4 enemies are damaged.
