This item allows the player to place any compatible Mana Lens in the path of a mana burst already travelling to change the effect after it's fired. Any of the four basic Mana Lenses used in this way will increase the range of the affected mana burst.

The Mana Prism must be placed in the world and will have no effect until a Mana Lens is applied using right-click. Mana bursts travelling through an active Mana Prism will be coloured to match the Mana Lens, if the Lens is not dyed they will be coloured white. The Prism can be turned OFF by applying a Redstone signal. A Prism with no Mana Lens is still treated by Mana Spreaders as a mana accepting block.
