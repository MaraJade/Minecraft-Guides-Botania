The Corporea system within Botania allows you to request items whenever you need them. There are a few blocks involved with Corporea and each have different functions within a Corporea network.

### Basics and Concept of Corporea
The basic idea behind Corporea is that its a set of inventories that are connected to each other wirelessly, you will be able to request items from any inventory within your Corporea network. Inventories are not limited to chests but these also include:

* Chests
* Trapped Chests
* Hoppers
* Dispensers
* Furnaces
* And more

Corporea will take items from the top of an inventory. There are 2 main components of a Corporea network, Normal Corporea Sparks and Master Corporea sparks. These work just like regular sparks but they will not transport mana. 

The Corporea sparks can be placed above any chest and can see what is within each inventory they are above, you must palace one of these above each chest you wish your Corporea network to see. 

The Master Corporea Spark will designate other sparks and tell them that they are one whole system, this also needs to be placed above a chest. You can use the Wand of the Forest to check what sparks are connected by right-clicking on the Master Corporea spark. Anything within the inventory underneath the Master Corporea spark can not be found within the system

There is no limit on how far these sparks reach, as long as the chunk they are in is loaded and as long as each Spark is a maximum 8 blocks away from another Spark. This means you can change sparks together running in any direction

You can also dye Corporea Sparks with Floral Powder, once right-clicked with the powder they will not be connected to any network, this enables you to have networks working in parallel with each other. Sparks can also be removed by Shift Right-Clicking with the Wand of the Forest.
