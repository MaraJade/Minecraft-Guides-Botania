**What is this mod about?**
Botania is a tech mod in essence. The theme is natural magic. By which the very base of the mod, as the title would give you the idea of, is flora. Of course, it's not limited to that. Most of the info on Botania can be found inside the game, in the Lexica Botania, the mod's "documentation book". You can craft it pretty easily with a book and any type of sapling.
